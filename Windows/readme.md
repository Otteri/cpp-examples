# Windows C++ examples

Examples in this folder utilize Windows system calls and therefore these demonstrations only work on Windows platform. Additionally, the fully functioning code samples are provided as Visual Studio projects, so it would be beneficial to have Visual Studio installed. When building the projects, one may need to update the solutions as the Microsoft continuously releases new versions of their tools.

Many of the examples demonstrate some kind of communication between programs or processes. For this reason, there are often two projects inside one demonstration folder. In these cases, both projects needs to be built and then only the main program should be run. Ideally the main program handles the other program or process itself.
