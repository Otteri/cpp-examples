# C++ examples

The intention of this repository is to provide code snippets that could be directly copy pasted and then modified to suit one's needs. The code should run as is. However, it is good to aknowledge that the snippets aren't anyhow optimal and they do not follow all the good practices. (E.g. proper error handling might be ignored in order to achieve more simple looking examples that are then easier to get grasp on).
